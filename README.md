# VBA_Challenge
Using an understanding of VBA and Microsoft Excell to sort through stock exchange data and create a spreadsheet for the years 2017 & 2018
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to understand how to use the programming language Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) within Microsoft excell in order to go through multiple data points in order to create an accurate and easy to follow automated report for stcoks in the years 2017 and 2018. For this excercise we used data given to us by Steve inthe form of two sheets (each corresponding to a year) in Microsoft Word.
## Results
* The results of this challenge resulted in two seperate sheets of data, one for 2017 and one for 2018, that compared the start and end prices, as well as the total volume for 12 different stocks in both 2018 and 2019 as shown in Images 1 and 2. This was done using VBA, which consisted of for loops, if-then statements, and the use of input and message boxes along with an imput value of the year in which a client would want to know about the stock values, which are shown in mages 3,4 anbd 5. When comparing 2017 to 2018, only RUN and TERP did better in 2018 as they did in 2017.
* When comparing the execution time for the original and the refractory code, for both years, the refractory code resulted in a faster execution time as compared to the original code.

## Summary
One general beneift of refracting a code is that it makes the code more managable and easy to read in case an issue with the code would ever arise. This allows for programmers to go into the code and get a better understanding of what the code is trying to do and how best to fix it, as oppsoed to scrolling through more lines than necessary to understand what the code is having trouble with.
* When comparing images 1 & 2 against images 6 & 7, an advantage to refracting the code is that there is a faster execution code when a refraction is done as oppsoed to the original.
* A Disanvantage of refracting the original code was that it required a lot more time to create the refraction, and more problems and errors were ran into in the process of making the new code.
* This shows that while the original code was easier to create and ran into less problems, it did execute at a slower time, and in the world of Finance and Stocks, time is money so every second you can save will have a big pay out.
